# my-image

[WIP]

Primary files to customize
- .github/workflows/build-disk-with-flatpaks.yml
- build_files/build.sh
- disk/user_flatpaks
- Containerfile

Note to self:
- Don't change anything in disk_config directory (yet)
- Don't change anything in Justfile (yet)
- Don't change anything in .github directory except the new custom workflow
- Eventually replace custom workflow with Titanoboa
